============
Introduction
============

This library acts as a frontend to SAT solvers and a helper for generating
CNF for sat solvers. It comes with bindings for MiniSAT (http://minisat.se/).

Have a look at demo_bit.cc and demo_vec.cc for examples of how to set up
a SAT problem using ezSAT. Have a look at puzzle3d.cc for a more complex
(real-world) example of using ezSAT.
